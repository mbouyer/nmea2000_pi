NMEA2000 plugin for OpenCPN
====================

License
=======
The plugin is licensed under the terms of GPL v2 or, at your will, later.

This plugin allows to interface opencpn to a CAN network through the
socketCAN interface. This means that this plugin will build only on
an OS which offers the socketCAN API (AFAIK only linux and NetBSD 8.0 or newer
at this time), and requires either a can loopback interface, or a
socketCAN-compatible CAN device.

This plugin has been developed and tested on NetBSD 8.0, running on a x86
host with a CAN loopback interface, and on a Onlimex lime2 board with
the integrated Allwinner CAN controller.

Note that, although this plugin tries to be compatible with NMEA2000 frames,
is has not been tested against a real NMEA2000 network, only against
a network of DIY devices implementing a subset of the J1939 stack.
It may not work when connected to a NMEA2000 network, and may even
cause other devices on the network to misbehave. You've been warned ...
